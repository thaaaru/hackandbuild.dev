    <h1>Interactive Guide to Learning Methods</h1>
    
    <p>Discover evidence-based learning techniques that help you learn faster and retain information better.</p>
    
    <div class="method">
        <h2>Active Recall</h2>
        <p class="effectiveness">Effectiveness: Very High</p>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Testing yourself on material without looking at the source.</p>
        <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Close your notes and try to write down everything you remember. Use flashcards or practice questions.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Forces your brain to retrieve information, strengthening neural pathways.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="method">
        <h2>Spaced Repetition</h2>
        <p class="effectiveness">Effectiveness: Very High</p>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Reviewing material at increasing intervals over time.</p>
        <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Review new material after 1 day, then 3 days, then 1 week, then 2 weeks, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Exploits the spacing effect to move information into long-term memory.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="method">
        <h2>Feynman Technique</h2>
        <p class="effectiveness">Effectiveness: High</p>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Explaining concepts in simple terms as if teaching someone else.</p>
        <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Choose a concept, explain it simply, identify gaps, and refine your explanation.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Reveals gaps in understanding and forces you to think clearly about concepts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="method">
        <h2>Interleaving</h2>
        <p class="effectiveness">Effectiveness: High</p>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Mixing different types of problems or topics in a single study session.</p>
        <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Instead of studying one topic for hours, switch between related topics every 20-30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Improves discrimination between concepts and enhances transfer of learning.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="method">
        <h2>Elaborative Interrogation</h2>
        <p class="effectiveness">Effectiveness: Medium-High</p>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Asking "why" and "how" questions about the material.</p>
        <p><strong>How to use:</strong> For each fact or concept, ask yourself why it's true and how it connects to other ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Creates meaningful connections and deeper understanding.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Creating Your Learning Plan</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose 2-3 techniques that appeal to you</li>
        <li>Start with active recall and spaced repetition</li>
        <li>Experiment with different combinations</li>
        <li>Track your progress and adjust as needed</li>
    </ol>
